## Directory Structure

```pseudo
OUTPUT_ORGANIZATION:
    
    Directory Naming:
        Pattern: {domain_with_underscores}
        Example: testphp_vulnweb_com
    
    File Naming:
        XSS: XSS-output.md
        SQL: Sql-Injection-output.md
        File Inclusion: File-Inclusion-output.txt
        Directory: Open-Directories-output.md
    
    Full Example:
        testphp_vulnweb_com/
        ├── XSS-output.md
        ├── Sql-Injection-output.md
        ├── File-Inclusion-output.txt
        └── Open-Directories-output.md


DIRECTORY_CREATION:
    Method: fs::create_dir_all()
    Behavior: Creates parent directories if needed
    Permissions: Default for current user
    Error Handling: Returns IO error if fails
```

## Severity Classification

```pseudo
SEVERITY_LEVELS:
    
    XSS:
        Reflected: Medium
            - Requires user interaction
            - Temporary impact
        
        Stored: High
            - Persistent threat
            - Affects all users
    
    SQL Injection: High
        - All types considered high
        - Can compromise entire database
        - Authentication bypass
        - Data exfiltration
    
    File Inclusion:
        LFI: High
            - Read sensitive files
            - Source code disclosure
        
        RFI: Critical
            - Remote code execution
            - Full system compromise
    
    Open Directories: Medium
        - Information disclosure
        - Aids reconnaissance
        - Potential sensitive data


CVSS_ALIGNMENT:
    Though not formally CVSS scored, severity aligns with:
        Critical: 9.0-10.0
        High: 7.0-8.9
        Medium: 4.0-6.9
        Low: 0.1-3.9
```

## Timestamp Formatting

```pseudo
TIMESTAMP_GENERATION:
    Library: chrono
    Function: Local::now()
    
    Format:
        2025-10-31 20:45:00 -05:00
        (Local time with timezone offset)
    
    Usage:
        Provides audit trail
        Helps with report versioning
        Legal compliance for security testing
```

## Error Handling

```pseudo
ERROR_CASES:
    
    1. Directory Creation Fails:
       - Permissions issue
       - Disk full
       - Invalid path
       
       Action: Return IO error
    
    2. File Creation Fails:
       - File already exists (overwritten)
       - Permissions issue
       
       Action: Return IO error
    
    3. Write Operations Fail:
       - Disk full
       - File system error
       
       Action: Return IO error
    
    4. Domain Extraction Fails:
       - Use "unknown_domain" as fallback
       - Continue with report generation


IDEMPOTENCY:
    Behavior: Reports can be regenerated
    File Handling: Overwrites existing reports
    Safety: Previous data lost on re-scan
```

## Usage Example

```pseudo
EXAMPLE_USAGE:
    
    // In main.rs after scanning
    CREATE reporter = Reporter::new()
    
    CALL reporter.report(&vulnerabilities, &target_url)
    IF error:
        PRINT "Error writing report: {error}"
    ELSE:
        PRINT "Report saved to {domain}/XSS-output.md"


TYPICAL_REPORT_SIZE:
    XSS Report:
        No vulns: ~500 bytes
        10 vulns: ~2-3 KB
    
    SQL Injection Report:
        Includes full documentation: ~3-4 KB base
        Per vuln: ~100 bytes additional
    
    Directory Report:
        100 directories: ~5-6 KB
```

## Future Enhancements (Potential)

    1. Multiple Format Support:
       - JSON output
       - XML output
       - CSV output
       - HTML with CSS
    
    2. Report Customization:
       - Templates

       - Custom sections
    
    3. Report Aggregation:
       - Combine multiple scans
       - Trend analysis
       - Comparison reports
    
    4. Integration:
       - JIRA tickets
       - Email sending
       - Slack notifications
    
    5. Enhanced Metadata:
       - Scanner version
       - System information
