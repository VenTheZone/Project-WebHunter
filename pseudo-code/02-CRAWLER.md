## Algorithm Analysis

```pseudo
CRAWLING ALGORITHM:
    Type: Breadth-First Search (BFS) with depth limit
    
    Time Complexity: O(N * D)
        N = number of pages
        D = max depth (2)
    
    Space Complexity: O(N)
        N = total URLs discovered
    
    Rate Limiting:
        - 200ms delay between requests
        - ~5 requests per second
        - Polite crawling to avoid server overload

VISITED TRACKING:
    Data Structure: HashSet
    Purpose: Prevent duplicate crawls
    Lookup Time: O(1) average case

USER AGENT ROTATION:
    Strategy: Round-robin based on depth
    Purpose: Mimic different browsers/bots
    Count: 7 different user agents
```

## Edge Cases Handled

```pseudo
EDGE_CASES:
    1. 404 Not Found:
       - Skip and continue to next URL
    
    2. Relative URLs:
       - Resolved against current page URL
    
    3. Fragment identifiers (#):
       - Removed (same page, different anchor)
    
    4. Cross-domain links:
       - Ignored (only crawl target domain)
    
    5. Non-HTTP(S) schemes:
       - Ignored (e.g., mailto:, javascript:)
    
    6. Forms without inputs:
       - Still recorded but won't be tested
    
    7. Inputs without names:
       - Skipped (can't be submitted)
    
    8. Network errors:
       - Silently caught, continue crawling
    
    9. Malformed HTML:
       - Parser handles gracefully
```

## Data Flow

```pseudo
DATA_FLOW:
    Input: target_url
    ↓
    Initialize crawler with target_url
    ↓
    FOR each depth level (0 to max_depth):
        ↓
        FOR each URL at current depth:
            ↓
            Send HTTP request
            ↓
            Parse HTML response
            ↓
            Extract links → Add to next_urls
            ↓
            Extract forms → Add to forms list
            ↓
            Mark URL as visited
    ↓
    Output: (all_discovered_urls, all_discovered_forms)
```
