## SQL Injection Detection Methods

```pseudo
THREE_DETECTION_TECHNIQUES:
    
    1. Error-Based Detection:
       Method: Inject syntax-breaking payloads
       Detection: Look for database error messages in response
       Advantages: Clear and definitive
       Example: ' OR 1=1-- causes "SQL syntax error"
    
    2. Boolean-Based Blind Detection:
       Method: Inject true/false conditions
       Detection: Compare response differences
       Advantages: Works when errors are hidden
       Example: 
           - id=1' AND 1=1-- returns normal page
           - id=1' AND 1=2-- returns different page
    
    3. Time-Based Blind Detection:
       Method: Inject time-delay functions
       Detection: Measure response time
       Advantages: Works when no visible difference
       Example: id=1'; WAITFOR DELAY '00:00:05'--
       Expected: Response takes 5+ seconds


PAYLOAD_EXAMPLES:
    
    Error-Based:
        - ' OR '1'='1
        - " OR "1"="1
        - ') OR ('1'='1
        - ' OR 1=1--
        - " OR 1=1--
        - '; DROP TABLE users--
    
    Boolean-Based (pairs):
        - ' AND '1'='1 / ' AND '1'='2
        - " AND "1"="1 / " AND "1"="2
        - 1' AND '1'='1 / 1' AND '1'='2
    
    Time-Based:
        - '; WAITFOR DELAY '00:00:05'--  (MSSQL)
        - '; SELECT SLEEP(5)--  (MySQL)
        - '; pg_sleep(5)--  (PostgreSQL)
        - ' AND (SELECT * FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))a)--
```

## Algorithm Complexity

```pseudo
COMPLEXITY_ANALYSIS:
    
    Per URL/Form:
        E = error-based payloads
        B = boolean-based payload pairs
        T = time-based payloads
        P = parameters per URL/form
        
        Total Tests = P * (E + 2B + T)
        
        Example:
            3 parameters
            10 error payloads
            5 boolean pairs
            5 time payloads
            
            Total = 3 * (10 + 2*5 + 5) = 3 * 25 = 75 tests
    
    Time Complexity: O(URLs * Parameters * Payloads)
    
    Request Rate: ~10-20 requests/second (with delays)
```

## Edge Cases

```pseudo
EDGE_CASES:
    
    1. 404 Responses:
       - Skipped to avoid false positives
    
    2. Time-Based False Positives:
       - Threshold set to 2 seconds (for 5-second delays)
       - Network latency considered
    
    3. Boolean-Based False Positives:
       - Only flag if responses significantly differ
       - Exact string comparison used
    
    4. Error Message Variations:
       - 12 different error patterns checked
       - Covers MySQL, MSSQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, SQLite
    
    5. Parameter Position:
       - Each parameter tested individually
       - Others keep original values
    
    6. Form Method Handling:
       - POST: Data in body
       - GET: Data in query string
```
